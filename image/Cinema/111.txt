ABOUT
The Mini Microcinema is dedicated to showing film/video/media that breaks from standard cinematic convention. We are a community that celebrates the art of the moving image, both contemporary and historical, from both near and far.

Our programming consists of work created outside of mainstream production and distribution systems, ultimately challenging Hollywood standards of form and content. The Mini Microcinema welcomes makers and viewers interested in exploring the potential of the cinematic medium.

Goodbye and THANK YOU volunteer party!

    Friday, September 11, 2015

We will be having a final "GOODBYE TO THE MINI + VOLUNTEER THANK YOU" party this Friday from 7-10pm in the Globe Gallery at People's Liberty.  It will be super low key.. no movies! We will have cookies and cupcakes and a few bottles of wine and beer. Stop by if you can and feel free to bring any other drinks or snacks!  At the party, I would also LOVE to get your feedback about the Mini and any suggestions/ideas to make it better in the future! 

Thanks again and hope to see you on Friday!

The party is for EVERYONE.. not just volunteers :)
